She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I've been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Forever in debt to your priceless advice

I'm so glad and I'm so grateful
She's been so kind and I'm so grateful
She's been so kind, I'm so glad
So grateful, so glad
So grateful, so glad

I'm a little birdy, I can't fly
I'm a little birdy, I can't fly
I'm a little birdy, I can't fly
I'm a little birdy, I can't fly
I'm a little birdy, I can't fly

I'm a little birdy, I can't fly
