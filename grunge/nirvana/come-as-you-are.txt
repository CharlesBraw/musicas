Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest, as a friend
As an old memory

Come doused in mud, soaked in bleach
As I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend
As an old mem-o-ry, mem-o-ry, mem-o-ry
Mem-o-ry, mem-o-ry

Come as you are, as you were
As I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend
As an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up
The choice is yours, don't be late
Take a rest, as a friend
As an old memory
Mem-o-ry, mem-o-ry, mem-o-ry
Mem-o-ry

And I swear that I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
No, I don't have a gun
